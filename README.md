Thank you so much for visiting my Hyprland rice. I'm relatively new to ricing, and while it's no where near perfect, I've put a lot of care into it. This rice is inspired by so many awesome people's work, though I regret I can't list everyone by name

I hope you enjoy it, and feel free to use this rice!

## Prerequisite
You have to disable autogenerate on the `hyprland.conf`.

### Steps

1. Open your terminal.

2. Traverse to `~/.config/hypr/`:
    
    ```bash
    cd ~/.config/hypr/
    ```

3. Use your favorite text editor to edit the `hyprland.conf` file. For example, using `nano`:
    
    ```bash
    nano hyprland.conf
    ```

4. Look for the section or line that enables autogeneration. This may look like:

    ```
    autogenerated=1
    ```

5. Disable autogeneration by changing the value to `0` or commenting out the line:

    ```bash
    # autogenerated=1
    ```

6. Save the file and exit the editor. For `nano`, press `Ctrl+O`, then `Enter` to save, and `Ctrl+X` to exit.

7. Restart Hyprland for the changes to take effect:
    
    ```bash
    hyprctl reload
    ```

8. Verify that the settings are no longer being autogenerated by checking if your custom configurations persist after a restart.

- `SUPER` typically refers to the Windows key or Command key, depending on your keyboard.
- These keybindings follow a HJKL (Left-Down-Up-Right) layout, inspired by VIM-style ergonomics for faster directional control.
- You can customize these further to suit your workflow or preferred keyboard layout.
